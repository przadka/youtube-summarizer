a. Main topics/themes:
- Multi-turn chat evaluation for LLM applications
- Error analysis as a starting point for evaluations
- LLM-as-a-judge methodology and alignment
- Tooling and infrastructure decisions (build vs buy)
- Prompt management and versioning strategies
- Vendor evaluation (Braintrust, Human Loop, LangSmith)

b. Key sentences/phrases:
1. The counterintuitive thing is to do an error analysis first before building evaluations
2. You need to align LLM-as-a-judge with human judgment and measure agreement
3. Make binary decisions (good/bad) rather than multi-point scales for actionable results
4. The process of creating evaluations often changes what you're actually looking for
5. For evaluation tooling, use vendors rather than building in-house since it's far from core business
6. Prompt storage location depends on whether non-developers need to iterate on prompts
7. Prompts often need access to application context, making external storage tricky

c. Notable quotes with timestamps:
- 2:50: Discussion of error analysis as starting point
- 6:46: "Don't get nerd sniped by evals" - fix obvious issues first
- 9:09: Every time doing LLM-as-judge exercise, people change what they're looking for
- 11:13: Binary decisions over multi-point scales
- 16:34: "For eval stuff, you want to use a vendor"

d. Structure outline:
- 0:00-2:50: Introduction and company background (Windmill)
- 2:50-6:45: Error analysis methodology 
- 6:45-12:00: LLM-as-a-judge alignment process
- 12:00-17:30: Tooling and vendor discussion
- 17:30-20:30: Prompt management strategies and wrap-up

Title: LLM Eval Office Hours #1: Multi-Turn Chat Evals

<overall_summary>
This office hours session features Hamel Husain advising Max from Windmill, a company building management automation tools with Slack-based AI agents. Max seeks guidance on evaluating multi-turn chat conversations as their LLM applications scale beyond manual prompt optimization. Hamel emphasizes starting with error analysis rather than jumping into evaluations, then using LLM-as-a-judge methodology with careful human-AI alignment. The discussion covers practical advice on tooling decisions (favoring vendors like Braintrust and Human Loop over in-house solutions), prompt management strategies, and the iterative nature of evaluation development where the process itself often clarifies what should actually be measured.

<memorable_quotes>
• [2:50] "The counterintuitive thing is like one thing that's really good to do is to do an error analysis first"
• [6:46] "Don't get nerd sniped by evals. Like in the extreme sense... if you find something that's obviously really wrong all the time, just go fix it"
• [9:09] "Every time I've done this exercise with people, LLM as a judge, people change what they're looking for significantly because like, the process of like doing it changes your mind about what should be done"
• [11:13] "Try to make binary decisions about if it's good or bad... Don't be wishy washy. Like, oh, it was like kind of good to hear, but it was kind of bad here"
• [16:34] "For eval stuff, you want to use a vendor... You don't want to be building that, you know. It's probably really far away from your core thing"

<detailed_summary>
**0:00 - 2:50: Company Background and Challenge**
Max introduces Windmill, a management automation company that uses Slack-based AI agents called "Windy" to collect peer feedback and weekly check-ins. They've reached a scale where manual prompt optimization is no longer sufficient and need robust evaluation systems for multi-turn chat conversations. The team consists of full-stack TypeScript engineers using a custom wrapper around Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

**2:50 - 6:45: Error Analysis Methodology**
Hamel emphasizes that the counterintuitive but crucial first step is conducting an error analysis rather than immediately building evaluations. This involves manually categorizing errors by looking at data where users dismissed chats or provided negative feedback. Max confirms they've already done some of this work, identifying cases where users said "I don't have any feedback" as indicators of poor question quality. Hamel stresses fixing obviously broken things immediately rather than getting "nerd sniped" by evaluation complexity.

**6:45 - 12:00: LLM-as-a-Judge Alignment Process**
The core methodology involves creating an LLM judge that matches human judgment through iterative alignment. Hamel explains that people consistently change their evaluation criteria during this process because writing specific critiques forces deeper thinking about what actually matters. Key principles include: making binary good/bad decisions rather than multi-point scales, including example critiques in prompts to train chain-of-thought reasoning, and measuring agreement between human and AI judges before trusting the system.

**12:00 - 17:30: Tooling and Vendor Evaluation**
For infrastructure decisions, Hamel strongly recommends using vendors rather than building evaluation tools in-house, since it's far from Windmill's core competency. He suggests evaluating Braintrust (his current favorite), Human Loop, and LangSmith. The choice depends on team preferences and existing tech stack - LangSmith works best if already using LangChain, while Braintrust suits TypeScript-focused teams well.

**17:30 - 20:30: Prompt Management Strategies**
The discussion covers prompt storage and versioning approaches. Hamel notes the trade-off between keeping prompts in the codebase (better for developer-only teams) versus external systems (better when non-developers need to iterate). He warns that prompts often need application context like database access, making external storage potentially complicated. The decision should be based on whether domain experts need direct prompt access and the team's comfort with having code outside their main repository.

Throughout the session, Hamel emphasizes that evaluation development is inherently iterative and that the process of building evaluations often provides as much value as the final evaluation system itself.
